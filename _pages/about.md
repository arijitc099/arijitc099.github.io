I am a Ph.D student in the Complex Resilient Intelligent Systems (CRIS) group of Professor Venkat Venkatasubramanian at Columbia University, New York.

My core research areas of interest include machine learning and artificial intelligence applications in chemical engineering, particularly arranging the marriage of first-principles knowledge with the machine so as to provide accurate, interpretable and reason-based predictions. Additionally, I like to study complex emergent systems.

I graduated from BITS Pilani-Goa Campus in 2020 with a Bachelor of Engineering (Honors) in Chemical Engineering. I am interested in applying my knowledge and skills to real world problems. Classical chemical engineering, as performed by the large MNCs and engineering contractors has always fascinated me. This resulted in the completion of industrial trainings- twice in the world renowned Reliance Industries Limited Jamnagar Refinery, and the other at Maire Tecnimont. Exposure to the same has helped me understand the industrial needs of chemical engineering, thus providing a different perspective to my field of study.

Additionally, I have worked on two industrial projects with Deccan Fine Chemicals in my junior year which involved extensive modelling and simulation of full-scale process plants on ASPEN Plus. This enabled me to develop a better understanding of the deliverables such as PFDs, BFDs and P&IDs. Having successfully completed the two projects, I am interested in the field of process systems engineering. Along those lines, I pursued my senior-year thesis at National University of Singapore (NUS) in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.

Outside of academics, I am excited about badminton, soccer, and reading books.
